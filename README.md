# Data Science Capstone Project
## for Coursera-IBM
In this project, I am assigned the role of a Data Scientist and was assigned the task to predict if the SpaceX Rocket Launcher Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a competing cost than other providers, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 
Hence the requirement of a analyzing and making predictions on first stage landing and if it can be reused.

I have completed this project in 5 steps as follows:
